# FetchAssessment

Hello,

I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to complete this assessment. Working on this challenge has been a valuable learning experience for me.

I have organized my files according to the order of the tasks provided. Files 0.1 and 0.1 contain the scripts for table creation from raw json files. File 1 includes a relational diagram illustrating how i would model the data in a data warehouse. Files 2.1 and 2.2 contain the SQL scripts for table creation and the queries used to answer the listed questions. File 3.1 is the Jupyter notebook I used to analyze data quality issues, and file 4 contains the Slack message.

Thank you once again for this opportunity. I look forward to discussing my work with you.

Best regards,
Uma
